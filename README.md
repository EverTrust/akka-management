# What is this

This is a fork of akka-management used to implement a fix of kubernetes cluster bootstrap in akka-management version 1.1.4,
by adding the `connect-by-ip` option.

### Warning

If this repo is one day upgraded to an ulterior version of akka-management, the changes must be of courses merged in the classes, but the `Dependencies.scala` file must also be updated.
